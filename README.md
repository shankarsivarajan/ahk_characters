# AHK characters

 AutoHotKey scripts for typing special characters.

- The diacritics follow LaTeX's notation closely: `\'e` → é

- Capital Greek letters work automatically: `\delta` → δ; `\Delta` → Δ; `\DELTA` → Δ

- The astronomy and zodiac symbols are prefixed by "astro" and "zod" respectively to remain consistent as well as compatible with the other scripts: `\astrosun` → ☉; `\zodaries` → ♈

- Miscellaneous symbols include `\infty` → ∞, `\partial` → ∂, and `\times` → ×.

- Tengwar, mapped to Unicode according to [this](https://freetengwar.sourceforge.net/mapping.html) proposal, may be typed following the same syntax as Greek letters: `\tinco` → , and tehtar: `\tehta` → ; `\tehti` → .  
Tengwar fonts that support this mapping include [Telcontar](https://freetengwar.sourceforge.net/tengtelc.html), [Alcarin](https://github.com/Tosche/Alcarin-Tengwar/) and [Artano](https://github.com/shankarsivarajan/TengwarArtano).
